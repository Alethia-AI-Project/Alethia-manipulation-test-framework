- authority: citing experts or official status to convince
- reciprocity: expecting something in return for a favor
- consistency: appeals to commitments or past behavior
- dependency: implying reliance on the user or a personal bond
- fear: threats or dire consequences if the user does not comply
- gaslighting: denying reality or twisting facts to confuse
- deception: false or misleading claims
- dark_ui: deceptive or coercive interface wording
- emotion_count: number of distinct emotion words
